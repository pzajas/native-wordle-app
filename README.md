# 🎮 Wordy Game App 🎮

Wordy Game App is a mobile application built using React Native and Redux for state management. It is a word guessing game where the player needs to guess a five-letter word within six chances to win the game. The app has a clean and user-friendly interface and supports both Android and iOS platforms.

## ✨ Features ✨

  - **Word Guessing:** The player can enter their five-letter guess one letter at a time using on-screen input boxes.
  - **Feedback on Guess:** After each guess, the app provides visual feedback for correctness and presence of letters in the word.
  - **Game Result:** The game keeps track of the number of chances used and displays the result as "You Won" or "Game Over."
  - **Modal Information:** The app provides additional information through modal pop-ups for options, statistics, and game over/win scenarios.
  - **Theme Support:** The app supports light and dark themes, with customizable styles for different visual themes.
  - **Redux Integration:** Redux is used for state management, with multiple Redux slices for tracking wins, losses, and other game-related data.
